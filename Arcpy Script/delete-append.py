* delete all features in given feature class
* append features in given feature class

Note: ArcMap editing on ArcSDE is notoriously slow. Workaround is
to download the complete the entire feature class to a local file (FGDB) 
(versioned checkout was causing problems too), edit locally and update 
(dump and restore) entire database on SDE once local updates are finished.
